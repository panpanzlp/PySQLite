PySQLite a SQLite Manager Software
=======================================================

Instruction
--
This project is dedicated to develop a pure python SQLite database management software. With the help of the software, we can expert a SQLite database table and store it as a ".sql" file type. This file type ".sql" matches the Firefox plugin for SQLite Manager. At the same time you can also import a similar *.sql file into the SQLite database or directly migrate a data table from one database to another. All operations are visualized. To help some people who do not have very well knowledge of SQLite database, so that they may simply manage a SQLite database.

Project characteristics
--

- Operation visualization
- Interface simple
- Single python file
- High Compatibly
- Multi-language support


The software currently supports Chinese, English and German. You can set the display language by changing the "DEFAULT_LANGUAGE" global variable. If you have more questions, or better suggestions. Welcome to contact me.
